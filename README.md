ABSTRACT
Performance studies have been a longtime topic of interest in the field of musicology. However, not many works have studied performance musical strategies using statistical and data analysis methodology.
This master's thesis aims to deepen the understanding of performance similarities and musical strategies of a sample of Johannes Brahms's cello sonatas recordings by using different statistical techniques.
For that, data related to the beat durations and intensities of these performances was used, coming from The Recorded Brahms Corpus (https://github.com/allorens/RBC).
Three different analyses were carried out. First, distances between performances were calculated to see the similarities between performances, and clustering algorithms were applied to check for possible performance groupings.
Secondly, musical measures were clustered into patterns using the k-means algorithm to determine the micro-rhythmic and micro-dynamic stylistic strategies of performers.
Finally, dynamic factor models were applied to the performance musical series to find latent factors in the performances.
